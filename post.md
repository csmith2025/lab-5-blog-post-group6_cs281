# Lab X: Doing stuff with hardware!

## Overview and Motivation
In this lab, we will design circuits that utilize memory in order to achieve increased functionality. Before this lab, we created different combinational circuits in which the outputs of the circuits were determined by the inputs directly. This means we weren't required to worry about memory, nor any notion of the sequence of operations that may have happened in the past.

This week, we will be working with Sequential Circuits. Sequential circuits introduce the idea of different states and being able to remember things about the previous input. The outputs can now be a function of both, inputs and previous internal state of the sequential circuit. In this lab, we will build a circuit that reads a binary number bit by bit and determines if that input (entire number) is divisible by 3. Each bit of the binary number will be clocked into the circuit sequentially, from the highest order bit to the lowest (left to right). As we recieve each bit, we must interpret it as this will equal to a different number than previous input/s and update our circuit's state accordingly.

To successfully be able to create this circuit, we need to make ourselves fimilar with Finite State Machine Design.
